# DAW Audit 19 — Recovery

Audit recovery after subsystem failure.

Ask for each major failure:

> Can the user continue working without losing unrelated work?

Verify:
- retry
- rollback
- reset
- reinitialize
- dismiss
- reopen
- safe project recovery
- plugin disable/recovery
- autosave restoration
- recovery from stuck busy/loading states

Test recovery paths rather than merely reading them.


## Global Rules

- Preserve intended product behavior unless a defect is clearly demonstrated.
- Do not add unrelated features.
- Prefer small, local, reversible fixes.
- When a confirmed, well-understood issue is safely fixable, reproduce it, fix it, add regression coverage where practical, and verify the result.
- Do not weaken tests, types, validation, error handling, or assertions merely to make checks pass.
- Do not manufacture work. If the audited area is healthy, verify it, report that no high-value action was found, and stop.
- Avoid broad architectural rewrites unless the audit reveals a concrete defect that cannot be solved safely otherwise.
- After every meaningful change, run relevant tests/checks.



## Completion Report

Confirmed defects, risks, or inconsistencies.

### Fixes
What was changed and why.

### Tests Added
Regression, integration, or E2E coverage added.
