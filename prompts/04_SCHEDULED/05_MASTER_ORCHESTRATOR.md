# DAW Hardening Orchestrator

## Purpose
Perform production-grade hardening on a DAW codebase. Treat reliability, data integrity, audio correctness, recoverability, and intent preservation as higher priorities than architectural novelty.

## Operating mode
Work in the following loop until the scoped audit is complete:

1. Inspect the relevant architecture, tests, runtime paths, persistence model, and existing documentation.
2. Identify concrete defects, unsafe assumptions, broken invariants, missing guards, or high-confidence reliability risks.
3. Reproduce or prove each issue before changing code whenever practical.
4. Fix the issue with the smallest safe change that preserves existing product behavior.
5. Add or improve automated regression coverage.
6. Run the relevant test, typecheck, lint, build, and targeted runtime validation available in the repository.
7. Re-inspect the modified area for secondary regressions.
8. Continue until no safe, high-confidence issue remains inside the current audit scope.

## Non-negotiable rules
- Do not redesign a working subsystem merely because another architecture looks cleaner.
- Hardening is not permission for speculative refactoring.
- Do not rename public contracts, project fields, command names, plugin parameters, IPC channels, persisted identifiers, or user-visible behavior unless required to fix a proven defect.
- Preserve backwards compatibility unless the repository explicitly documents a breaking migration.
- Never silently discard user data.
- Never weaken validation to make tests pass.
- Never remove a failing test unless it is demonstrably obsolete and replaced with equivalent or stronger coverage.
- Prefer deterministic fixes over timing sleeps, retries, or broad catch-all error suppression.
- Avoid broad changes spanning unrelated systems.
- If a risky issue cannot be safely fixed, isolate it, document it, add a failing or quarantined regression test if appropriate, and explain the exact blocker.

## Required output at completion
Report:
- defects found and fixed;
- tests added or strengthened;
- commands executed and outcomes;
- remaining risks or unresolved items;
- files changed;
- whether the audited subsystem is safer than before and why.

## Scheduled mission

Execute hardening in controlled phases. Do not run all audits as one giant refactor.

Phase order:
1. Critical path
2. Project/data integrity
3. Recovery
4. Undo/redo
5. State/contracts
6. Audio-specific engine audit
7. Product-specific audits
8. Performance/resource leaks
9. Security/dependencies/dead code
10. Final reliability sweep

For each phase use:
AUDIT → REPRODUCE → FIX → VERIFY → REGRESSION TEST → STABLE CHECKPOINT → NEXT DOMAIN

Do not advance when the current phase has failing validation caused by your changes. Keep each phase independently reviewable. Respect repository-level AGENTS.md, contributing rules, test conventions, and documented product invariants.
