# Editor Quality Audit — KYX / Pulse Forge

Scope: the timeline/arrangement editor — clip commands, selection state, undo/redo
transaction boundaries, coordinate conversion, and the interaction state machine.

Method: read the implementation, then **reproduce every claimed defect with a failing
test before fixing it**. No defect below is reported on the strength of a code reading
alone. A defect is marked CONFIRMED only where a test failed first and passed after
the fix.

Every section distinguishes **VERIFIED** (read and, where stated, reproduced) from
**UNCONFIRMED** (a specific suspicion that needs an instrumented repro to settle).

---

## Baseline

Before any change, the timeline/undo suites were green:

```
tests/arrangement-tools-audit      tests/undo-redo-integrity
tests/arrangement-variations       tests/undo-roundtrip-sweep
tests/clip-editing-audit-deep      tests/selection-store-dead-refs
tests/clip-editing-audit2          tests/update-audio-clip
tests/editing-timeline-audit       tests/undo-redo-audit

Test Files  10 passed (10)
      Tests  155 passed (155)
```

This matters: a green baseline is what lets every failure below be attributed to a
change I made rather than to pre-existing damage.

## D1 — A clip's fade can outlive the clip (P2, CONFIRMED)

### Invariant

```
0 <= fadeIn  <= duration(clip)
0 <= fadeOut <= duration(clip)
duration(clip) = lengthBars * BAR_TICKS * 60 / (bpm * PPQ)
```

A fade longer than its clip is not cosmetic. The engine clamps it audibly, so the
stored document disagrees with both what the user hears and where the fade handles
are drawn.

### Root cause

Three **structural fragment builders** derive their fragments by spreading the parent
clip (`...clip`) and overwriting only the geometry — never the fades:

| Command                       | Parent fade copied                   | Fragment can be as short as         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `splitAudioClipAtTick`        | `fadeIn` → left fragment             | 0.05 bar (`leftBars < 0.05` throws) |
| `splitAudioClipAtTick`        | `fadeOut` → right fragment           | 0.05 bar                            |
| `sliceAudioClipToArrangement` | `fadeIn` + `fadeOut` → every slice   | one sample wide                     |
| `stripSilenceAudioClip`       | `fadeIn` + `fadeOut` → every segment | one sample wide                     |

The sibling commands that rewrite a clip's length _in place_ — `resizeAudioClip`,
`stretchAudioClip`, `trimAudioClipStart` — all clamped correctly, with an explicit
comment citing the audit. The three fragment builders were the siblings that missed it.

### Reproduction (measured, before the fix)

An 8-bar clip (16 s at the default 120 BPM) carrying `fadeIn: 4`, `fadeOut: 3`:

```
splitAudioClipAtTick, left   lengthBars 0.1 → 0.194 s,  fadeIn  4.000   ← 20× the clip
splitAudioClipAtTick, right  lengthBars 0.1 → 0.194 s,  fadeOut 3.000   ← 15× the clip
sliceAudioClipToArrangement   lengthBars 0.3 → 1.490 s,  fadeIn  4.000
sliceAudioClipToArrangement   lengthBars 0.1 → 0.480 s,  fadeIn  4.000
stripSilenceAudioClip         0.097 s clip,               fadeIn  4.000
```

5 of 7 assertions failed; the baseline and undo assertions passed.

### Fix

`src/commands/commands.ts`

- New `audioClipDurationSec(doc, lengthBars)` — one formula for "how long is this clip".
- New `clampClipFades(doc, clip, lengthBars)` — the invariant, taking the clip's
  **stored** length (post-rounding, post-clamp) so the bound matches the length that
  actually lands in the document.
- Applied at all six length-rewriting call sites; the three fragment builders now
  bound the inherited fades by their own fragment length.

### Regression coverage

`tests/clip-fade-bounds-invariant.test.ts` — 7 tests, including an undo round-trip
(which was already correct and is pinned so it stays that way).

---

## D2 — The clip selection keeps ids for clips that no longer exist (P2, CONFIRMED)

### Invariant

Every id in the selection names a live object. The track half of this contract already
existed: `SelectionStore.pruneTrack` / `retainTracks`, covered by
`tests/selection-store-dead-refs.test.ts`. The clip half did not.

### Root cause

Commands are pure `ProjectDocument → Command` and cannot see the UI selection, so a
destructive action has to drop the dead ids at its own call site. The keyboard Delete
path in `App.tsx` calls `selectionStore.clear()` — but the context menu, the DEL
buttons and `deleteClipsWithToast` cleared only the panel's **local** `selectedClipId`
/ `selectedAudioClipId`. `selection.clipIds` kept naming a deleted clip.

### Reproduction (measured, before the fix)

```
selection kept a dead clip id after delete: expected [ Array(1) ] to deeply equal []
```

### Consequences (not speculation — read off the code)

- **Dead undo entries.** The next Delete maps `selection.clipIds` through the live id
  sets, matches nothing, leaves the document untouched — and still executes its
  `deleteClips` command with `execute: () => newDoc` where `newDoc === doc`. A history
  entry the user must Ctrl+Z through for no edit.
- **Dead UI.** The context menu keeps reporting `hasClips`, so Duplicate / Consolidate
  / Split stay enabled over a selection that resolves to nothing.
- **Not delete-specific.** `splitAudioClipAtTick` replaces a clip's id with two new
  ids, so a split of a selected clip produces the same ghost without any delete.

### Fix

- `SelectionStore.retainClips(liveIds)` — the clip-side counterpart to `retainTracks`,
  no-op without emitting when everything is still live.
- `src/ui/useClipSelectionInvariant.ts` — `pruneDeadClipIds(store, selectionStore)` plus
  a hook that subscribes it to `store.subscribe`, so it fires on **every** mutation
  source at once: buttons, context menu, keyboard, MCP, the intent engine, collab and
  undo/redo.
- Mounted in `App.tsx` — the component that owns the `SelectionStore`.

Typed against a structural `ClipSelectionSource` (`getDoc` + `subscribe`) rather than
the concrete `ProjectStore`, because `services.store` is a union with the collab
`YDocStore`, which mirrors the same surface.

### Regression coverage

`tests/ui/selection-clip-dead-refs.test.ts` — 9 tests, including the no-emit-when-nothing-
changed guard (re-rendering every selection subscriber on every mutation is a real cost)
and the "does not touch `trackIds` / `noteSelections`" boundary.

## D3 — Escape and window-blur do not cancel a timeline drag (P1, CONFIRMED)

### Invariant (§20 cancel and recovery)

An incomplete interaction must roll back cleanly or commit under explicit semantics. No
operation may leave the editor stuck in a dragging/trimming state.

### Root cause

Every drag machine in `ArrangementPanel.tsx` wired exactly two terminals —
`onPointerUp` (commit) and `onPointerCancel` (abort). Escape and window-blur are
neither, and the panel registers no `window` pointerup/blur listener, unlike its
siblings `Sequencer.tsx:1766-1768` and `App.tsx:422-423`.

### Reproduction (measured, before the fix)

```
✗ does NOT commit the move when Escape is pressed between pointerdown and pointerup
✗ clears a latched drag preview when the window loses focus mid-drag
✓ still commits the move when no cancel key is pressed     ← control
✓ cancels a marquee drag on Escape
```

The control passing is what makes the other two meaningful: the harness genuinely
drags and genuinely commits.

### Why this was P1 and not cosmetic

`dragRef.current` holds `movingIds` captured **at gesture start**. Escape does not clear
it, so releasing the mouse afterwards **commits the move** — after the user pressed the
cancel key. `App.tsx`'s contextual Escape handler calls `selectionStore.clear()` at that
same moment, so the selection visibly vanished while the clip slid anyway.

Losing window focus had the second half: no `pointercancel` is delivered, so the preview
stayed latched — the clip painted at a drag offset with no gesture behind it.

### Fix

`src/ui/ArrangementPanel.tsx`

- `cancelAllArrangementGestures()` fans out to every top-level ref: clip drag,
  multi-drag, audio drag + its fade/gain/stretch previews, marquee, ruler time-drag,
  take-lane drag.
- One window listener set: `keydown Escape`, `blur`, `pointercancel` (the last is a
  backstop; all three paths are idempotent).
- Deliberately **no** `stopPropagation` — `App.tsx` still owns contextual Escape
  (close menu → close help → clear selection → reset tool → blur input), and cancelling a
  gesture is independent of that cascade.
- The Escape path only acts when a gesture is actually live, so Escape behaviour is
  otherwise untouched.

Two overlay drags live in **child** components with their own refs (`WarpPinsOverlay`,
`IntensityLane`). The panel cannot reach into them, so it bumps an `overlayCancelEpoch`
counter that each child resets against. Without this a dragged warp pin or intensity
point would still commit after a cancel.

### Regression coverage

`tests/ui/arrangement-escape-cancels-drag.test.tsx` — 5 tests, including the control.

---

## Collateral fix — a test asserting a param id that does not exist

`tests/commands.test.ts` used `{ kind: "fxParam", paramId: "lowGain" }` against an `eq`
instance. `eqParams` (`src/effects/definitions.ts:468`) has no `lowGain`; the low-shelf
gain is `lowShelfGain` (bare `lowGain` belongs to the **M/S EQ** definition). The target
validator correctly rejected it, so the test failed with `Invalid macro target`.

Unrelated to D1–D3 and pre-existing — none of the changes touch the effect registry or
the macro-target path. Fixed to `lowShelfGain`, preserving the test's intent (a generic
FX target mapping carries a `source`). 69/69 in that file pass.

## Audited and found correct

These were checked and are **not** defects. Stating them matters as much as the findings.

| Area                               | Evidence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gesture transaction boundaries** | A drag is preview-only in React state; exactly ONE command is committed on `onPointerUp`. No per-`pointermove` dispatch, so a continuous drag cannot produce dozens of undo entries.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Editor → audio engine sync**     | `services.ts:1024` `store.onDocChanged` calls `engine.setProject(doc)`, and `engine.restartFrozenSources(transport.position)` when playing — the ghost-audio guard for structural edits during playback.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Waveform rendering**             | `audioClipWaveformWindow` (`audioClipChannels.ts:46`) is a shared function that mirrors `audioClipPlayWindow`, so the drawn envelope is the window actually played. Defensive against degenerate windows.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Undo/redo integrity**            | 155-test baseline plus `undo-roundtrip-sweep` green; the split undo round-trip restores the parent document verbatim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Coord conversion round-trip**    | `barFromEvent` / `audioBarFromEvent` are self-consistent and negate cleanly on the same rect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Determinism**                    | `snapshot()` (`commands.ts:150`) records a **document delta** (`computeDocDelta`), id-anchored, not a whole-document chain. Forward and backward deltas are both computed, so undo survives a document that changed between dispatch and undo (async render, collab merge). A dev-only verifier re-applies each delta and compares, with a legacy whole-document fallback. |

## Remaining risk — intentionally left unchanged

Each is a real observation with the reason it was not auto-fixed.

1. **Ten inline px→beat conversion sites in `ArrangementPanel.tsx` alone** (VERIFIED count
   by grep). Lines 1687, 1696, 1703, 3139, 3151, 3243, 3260, 3271, 3290 all recompute
   `(event.clientX - rect.left) / barWidth` inline, with three different rounding
   policies — `Math.floor` (1687, 3290), no rounding (1696, 1703, 3139, 3243, 3260),
   and `Math.min(totalBars, …)` clamping (3151, 3271). Line 561 is a different formula
   again: `((el.scrollLeft + cursorX) / (BASE_BAR_WIDTH * zoomRef.current)) * BAR_TICKS`.
   Today they agree on the tested inputs, but a snap threshold or half-pixel rule fixed
   in one place would silently diverge from the others. Consolidating this into one
   module is an architectural change touching every panel — a human-review decision,
   not an auto-fix.

2. **Mid-drag zoom or horizontal scroll re-scales a live drag** (UNCONFIRMED).
   `deltaBasis` is captured at gesture start; changing `zoom` or `scrollLeft` mid-drag
   leaves the delta in the old px scale while the preview is drawn in the new one. Needs
   an instrumented repro to confirm it is user-visible; plausible but not established.

3. **`onAudioPointerUp` mixes two document bases** (UNCONFIRMED).
   It computes `offsetSec` from `audioClips` captured at gesture start, while
   `trimAudioClipStart` re-resolves the clip from the live document at execute time. If
   the document changed between pointerdown and pointerup, the two can disagree.

4. **Right-edge resize override in `onClipPointerMove`** (VERIFIED as written, impact
   unquantified) — a `drag.resize === "right"` branch overrides the dragged length after
   snapping. Intended behaviour, flagged only because it bypasses the snap result.

5. **No clipboard in the arrangement timeline** (VERIFIED absent).
   `grep -ri clipboard src/` returns nothing. Copy/paste/duplicate-paste does not exist
   for timeline clips, so §30 clipboard integrity is not applicable to this editor.
   Duplicate is implemented separately.

6. **Audio-clip drag cancel.** The `WarpPinsOverlay` and `IntensityLane` cancel paths are
   reached only through the new epoch token. They have no window-level listener of their
   own, so a cancel arriving while the parent panel is unmounting depends on the parent's
   cleanup — correct today, but it is a contract rather than an independent guarantee.

### Documentation drift corrected along the way

`AGENTS.md` stated the DAW JS budget as **3170 KB** in two places (§4 and §7). The
enforcing value is `TOTAL_BUDGET_KB = 3500` in `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs:85`, and the
measured build is 3464 KB. The doc was stale — and stale in the dangerous direction,
reading as though there were 290 KB of headroom that does not exist. Both occurrences
corrected to 3500 KB.
